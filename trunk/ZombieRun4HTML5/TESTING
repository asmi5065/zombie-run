Notes on testing:

The HTML5 version of Zombie, Run! can be developed in:

  Firefox 3.5 (which has support for the W3C location API) - this tests the iPhone.
  Safari 4.0 with Google Gears (wherein it does not have support for the W3C location API, but
    does support the Gears location API) - this tests the Android platform.

and should always be verified in:

  iPhone OS 3.0 on a G3, ideally also on a G3S
  The current version of Android on a G1, ideally also on a Hero



Functional Testing Plan:

On all platforms,
 * Start-new-game works.
 * Rejecting location access shows an appropriate error message.
