= Serialization =

Data about the Zombie objects must be serialized.  This means that all variables that the zombie class contains must be able to be transfered via the Zombie::toString and Zombie::fromString methods.

This is important for two reasons:

  # When the android interface is flipped from portrait to landscape or vice versa any data that is not serialized will be lost.
  # When playing in multi-player only serialized data is transfered to the other players.
