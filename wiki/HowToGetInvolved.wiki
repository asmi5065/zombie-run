#summary How to begin contributing code or resources to Zombie, Run!.

I'm glad you're interested in contributing to Zombie, Run!  There are current needs for everything from game design, ui design, coding, graphics work, and testing.  If you are interested in any of those aspects, please email Peter at peterjdolan+zombierun@gmail.com for more information.

To start, feel free to checkout the current code, which includes the multiplayer game server (to be run on Google AppEngine), the HTML for the zrli.org website, and the code for the Android game itself.  Dig around and see how messy things currently are, and drop Peter a note if you have any questions at all or want to start contributing some patches!
